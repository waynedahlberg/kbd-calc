#  Layout notes

max size for ipad keys: 128pt

max size for phone is basically take geometry reader of device width and divide by 4.

height is basically the width, with exception of non-square keys, grid spaces.


Aspect ratio for the display is 2.19-ish. Fills entire area on touch-id phones, leaves room for some branding, skewy for iphone-X+ later phones.

Do not waste time right now on horizontal layout. Do that after shipping v1
